This folder contains the most important code for the analysis of the Tb155 CERN-MEDICIS collections.
Activity_from_spectra.ipynb contains the code to calculate the activity corresponding to Tb155, given a gamma spectrum. This code can be generalized towards any radionuclide if the energylines and corresponding intensities are known.
LaserIonizationCurrent_Activity_current.py contains the code to calculate the laser resonance ionization current as well as the current corresponding to a set of activities.
schemeab.py contains the code for the analysis of the laser resonance ionization current corresponding to both schemes seperately.

(The efficiency fit in Activity_from_spectra.ipynb is based on a code written by Michael Heines.)
