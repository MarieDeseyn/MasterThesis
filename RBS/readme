This folder contains the necessary code to analyze the RBS spectra.

makefiles.py generates the files for the TRIDYN simulation, in order for this program to run template.in is needed.
Experimental confirmation.ipynb analyzes the RBS spectra and provides a comparison with the TRIDYN simulations.

ValidIntegral.ipynb contains the code that provides evidence for the fact that the integral over the peaks can be used to obtain the fluence retained into the foil.

(The code to plot the results from the TRIDYN simulations is based on a code written by Michael Heines)
