This folder contains the necessary files to generate and analyze the implantation of a specific medical isotope into aluminium, zinc, dextrates, cellulose, NaCl, NaNO3.

makefilesotherisotopes.py contains the code to generate the TRIDYN input files, in order to run this code, template.in is needed.
execute.sh is a bash script to run multiple TRIDYN simulations in an automatical way and was made by Michael Heines.
analysis code TRIDYN - different isotopes and substrates_new.ipynb contains the code to analyze the TRIDYN output.

(analysis code TRIDYN - different isotopes and substrates_new.ipynb makes use of a code written by Michael Heines)
