# MasterThesis
Code corresponding to my master thesis (2022-2023) on Maximizing the radionuclide collection efficiency at CERN-MEDICIS: A case study on terbium collections and sputtering.

It contains the code for calculating the activity of Tb155 given a gamma spectrum (the code is written such that it can be generalized for any radionuclide), the code to calculate the laser ionization current (corresponding to both laser schemes together and both schemes seperately) as well as the current corresponding to an activity. (Folder: Collection analysis)
Additionally, the necessary code for generating the TRIDYN input files for implantation of a chosen element in different foil materials is present as well as the analysis code to analyze the corresponding TRIDYN output. (Folder: TRIDYN_medical_isotope_implantation)
Also, the code to investigate the effect of the purity of the beam on self-sputtering is included for Gd implanted prior and simultaneously with Tb. (Folder: TRIDYN_purity_of_beam)
Furthermore, the code to run a layered simulation in an automatical way is included. (Folder: TRIDYN_layered_simulations)
Additionally, the code to analyze an RBS spectra and compare it to the TRIDYN simulations is present. (Folder: RBS)
Lastle, the code for the recoil-sputtering simulations is included (Folder: Recoil-sputtering).

### Data availability
The dataset used in this project was obtained during the 3 Tb155 MEDICIS collections of 2022.
