This folder contains the necessary code for the generation and analysis of terbium implanted together with gadolinium.
------ Gd_prior ------
Gd_prior_to_Tb.py contains the code to generate the necessary TRIDYN input files, in order to do so templateTb.in and template.in are needed. The TRIDYN simulations should be executed in two steps (1: Gd implantation, 2: Tb implantation for the Gd-implanted target)
Analysis_Gd_prior_to_Tb.ipynb contains the code to analyze the TRIDYN output.

(Analysis_Gd_prior_to_Tb.ipynb is based on a code written by Michael Heines)

------ Gd_simultaneously ------ 
filesfractionGdTb.py generates the TRIDYN input files.
Analysis_Gd_simultaneously.ipynb contains the code to analyze the TRIDYN output.
